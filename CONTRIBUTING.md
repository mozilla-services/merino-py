Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project. Feel free to get in touch with
other community members on [Matrix][matrix], the mailing list or through issues here on
GitHub.

## Bug Reports

You can file issues here on GitHub. Please try to include as much information as
you can and under what conditions you saw the issue.

## Sending Pull Requests

Patches should be submitted as pull requests (PR).

Before submitting a PR:

- Ensure you are pulling from the most recent `main` branch and install dependencies with Poetry.
  See the [developer documentation][developer documentation] for more details.
- Your code must run and pass all the automated tests before you submit your PR
  for review. See the [developer documentation][developer documentation] for information on linting,
  formatting and testing. "Work in progress" or "Draft" pull requests are allowed to be submitted,
  but should be clearly labeled as such and should not be merged until all tests pass and the code
  has been reviewed.
- Ideally, your patch should include new tests that cover your changes. It is your and
  your reviewer's responsibility to ensure your patch includes adequate tests.
- If making changes that may impact performance, it is recommended to execute a load test. Please
  see the [Load Testing README][load_testing_readme] for more information.
- For more information on understanding the release process, please see relevant information
  contained in the [release-process.md][release_process] documentation.

When submitting a PR:

- You agree to license your code under the project's open source license ([MPL 2.0][license]).
- Base your branch off the current `main`.
- Add both your code and new tests if relevant.
- [Sign][sign] your git commit.
- Run tests, linting and formatting checks to make sure your code complies with established standards.
(e.g. No warnings are returned for python: "`make lint`", "`make test`", "`make format`")
- Ensure your changes do not reduce code coverage of the test suite.
- Please do not include merge commits in pull requests; include only commits
  with the new relevant code.

## Code Review

This project is production Mozilla code and subject to our
[committing rules and responsibilities][committing_rules_and_responsibilities]. 
Every patch must be peer reviewed.

## Git Commit Guidelines & Branch Naming

We loosely follow the [Angular commit guidelines][angular_commit_guidelines]
of `<type>: <subject>` where `type` must be one of:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests, test maintenance, and adding test features
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

If associated with a Jira ticket, synchronization with Jira and GitHub is possible by appending the suffix of the Jiraticket to the branch name (`MOZ-1234` in the example below). Name the branch using this nomenclature with the optional `<type>` followed by a forward slash, followed by the Jira ticket and then a 
dash-separated description of the task. Ex. `feat/MOZ-1234-add-sentry-sdk` or `MOZ-1234-add-sentry-sdk` Note, the Jira ticket project and number can be added anywhere in the
branch name, but adding to the beginning is ideal. You can also include the Jira issue at the end of
commit messages to keep the task up to date. See Jira Docs for referencing issues [here][jira]

[jira]: https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/reference-issues-in-your-development-work/

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body

In order to maintain a reference to the context of the commit, add
`Closes #<issue_number>` if it closes a related issue or `Issue #<issue_number>`
if it's a partial fix.

You can also write a detailed description of the commit: Just as in the
**subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor
"changes" It should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with
previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also
the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

### Example

A properly formatted commit message should look like:

```
feat: give the developers a delicious cookie

Properly formatted commit messages provide understandable history and
documentation. This patch will provide a delicious cookie when all tests have
passed and the commit message is properly formatted.

BREAKING CHANGE: This patch requires developer to lower expectations about
    what "delicious" and "cookie" may mean. Some sadness may result.

Closes #314, Closes #975
```

## Testing Guidelines & Best Practices

All test contributions should conform to the documented [Test Strategy][test_strategy] and have the
following qualities (also known as the F.I.R.S.T. principles):

**Fast**

* Test suites should be optimized to execute quickly, which encourages use by contributors and is
  essential for rapid pipelines.
* If tests are taking too long, consider breaking them up into multiple smaller tests and executing
  them with a parallel test runner.
* For reference, unit tests should take milliseconds to run.

**Isolated**

* Tests should be independently executable or standalone, not relying on an execution order with
  other tests.
* Tests should clean up after themselves
    * Tests may perform actions that have persistent effects, like setting a program state. If not
      cleaned up properly, this can impact the execution of subsequent tests causing intermittent
      failures.
    * Helper methods or fixtures are a preferable architectural design when compared to setup and
      teardown methods. As test suites scale, setup and teardown methods become a common source of
      state issues and bloat. Tests will grow to have increasingly specific requirements that don't
      have common relevancy or compatibility.
* Tests should not rely on resources from sites whose content Mozilla doesn't control or where
  Mozilla has no SLA. This is a security concern as well as a source of intermittent failures.
* Tests should avoid file system or database dependencies, their changes or outages can be a source
  of intermittent failures.

**Repeatable**

* Tests should have consistent results when no code changes are made between test runs.
* Tests should not contain time bombs. Meaning they should not be susceptible to failure given
  execution during a given datetime or due to time comparisons.
* Tests should avoid using _magical_ time delays when waiting for operations to finish executing.
* Tests should not assume an execution order for asynchronous methods, this may lead to intermittent
  failures.
* Tests should not depend on objects through weak references, which may be garbage collected during
  test execution causing intermittent failures.
* Tests should avoid using logical operations, such as `if`, `while`, `for`, and `switch`.
    * Decision points are a nexus for introducing bugs. Bugs found in test code erodes trust and
      diminishes value.
    * Consider splitting up a test or using a data driven test framework before using logical
      operations.
* Test CI/CD jobs should avoid pulling the latest language or tooling dependencies. New dependency
  versions can cause unintuitive failures.

**Self-Deterministic**

* No human intervention should be required to conclude if a test has passed or failed.

**Timely**

* Production code should be crafted to be testable, so that writing and maintaining tests doesn't
  take an unreasonable amount of time.
* Test code should be written with the same quality standard as production code and subject to the
  same linters and formatters.
* Consider using a test-first approach when developing production code.
