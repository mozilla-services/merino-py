    """Query Merino for suggestions.

    This is the primary endpoint that consumes user input and suggests
    pages the user may want to visit. The expectation is that
    this is shown alongside other content the browser suggests
    to the user, such as bookmarks and history.

    This endpoint accepts GET requests and takes parameters as query string values
    and headers.

    **Args:**

    - `q`: The query that the user has typed. This is expected to be a partial
        input, sent as fast as once per keystroke, though a slower period may be
        appropriate for the user agent.
    - `city`: [Optional] City name. E.g. “New York”. If provided,
        Accuweather provider returns weather suggestions based on this city. Note: If provided,
        `region` and `country` must also be provided to successfully return weather suggestions.
    - `country`: [Optional] ISO 3166-2 country code. E.g.: “US”. If provided,
        Accuweather provider returns weather suggestions based on this country. Note: If provided,
        `city` and `region` must also be provided to successfully return weather suggestions.
    - `region`: [Optional] Subdivision code. E.g. : “NY”. If provided,
        Accuweather provider returns weather suggestions based on this region. Note: If provided,
        `city` and `country` must also be provided to successfully return weather suggestions.
    - `client_variants`: [Optional] A comma-separated list of any experiments or
        rollouts that are affecting the client's Suggest experience. If Merino
        recognizes any of them it will modify its behavior accordingly.
    - `providers`: [Optional] A comma-separated list of providers to use for this
        request. See the `/providers` endpoint below for valid options. If provided,
        only suggestions from the listed providers will be returned. If not provided,
        Merino will use a built-in default set of providers. The default set of
        providers can be seen in the `/providers` endpoint. Supplying the `default`
        value to the `providers` parameter will return suggestions from the default providers.
        You can then pass other providers that are not enabled after `default`,
        allowing for customization of the suggestion request.
    - `request_type`: [Optional] For AccuWeather provider, the request type should be either a
        "location" or "weather" string. For "location" it will get location completion
        suggestion. For "weather" it will return weather suggestions. If omitted, it defaults
        to weather suggestions.

    **Headers:**

    - `Accept-Language` - The locale preferences expressed in this header in
      accordance with [RFC 2616 section 14.4][rfc-2616-14-4] will be used to
      determine suggestions. Merino maintains a list of supported locales. Merino
      will choose the locale from its list that has the highest `q` (quality) value
      in the user's `Accept-Language` header. Locales with `q=0` will not be used.

      If no locales match, Merino will not return any suggestions. If the header is
      not included or empty, Merino will default to the `en-US` locale.

      If the highest quality, compatible language produces no suggestion results,
      Merino will return an empty list instead of attempting to query other
      languages.

    - `User-Agent` - A user's device form factor, operating system, and
      browser/Firefox version are detected from the `User-Agent` header included in
      the request.

    [rfc-2616-14-4]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616/#section-14.4

    **Other derived inputs:**

    - Location - The IP address of the user or nearest proxy will be used to
      determine location. This location may be as granular as city level, depending
      on server configuration.

      Users that use VPN services will be identified according to the VPN exit node
      they use, allowing them to change Merino's understanding of their location.
      VPN exit nodes are often mis-identified in geolocation databases, and may
      produce unreliable results.


    **Returns:**

    The response will be a JSON object containing the following keys:
    - `client_variants` - A list of strings specified from the `client_variants`
        parameter in the request.
    - `server_variants` - A list of strings indicating the server variants.
    - `request_id` - A string identifier identifying every API request sent from Firefox.
    - `suggestions` - A list of suggestions or an empty list if nothing was found.
        Please look at the documentation for `BaseSuggestion` model for information
        about what the model contains.

    **Response Headers:**

    Responses will carry standard HTTP caching headers that indicate the validity of
    the suggestions. User agents should prefer to provide the user with cached
    results as indicated by these headers.

    - `locale`: The Firefox installed locale, for example en, en-US, de-DE.
        See the Request body schema below for the full list of supported values.
        This will determine the language of the recommendations.
    - `region`: [Optional] The country-level region, for example US or IE (Ireland).
        This will help return more relevant recommendations. If `region` is not provided,
        then region is extracted from the `locale` parameter if it contains two parts (e.g. en-US).
    - `count`: [Optional] The maximum number of recommendations to return. Defaults to 100.
    - `topics`: [Optional] A list of preferred [topics][curated-topics-doc].
    - `feeds`: [Optional] A list of additional data feeds. Currently, accepts
       only three values: 'need_to_know', 'fakespot', and 'sections'.
    - `experimentName`: [Optional] The Nimbus New Tab experiment name that the user is enrolled in.
        When an experiment _only_ requires backend changes, this allows us to run the experiments
        without waiting on the Firefox release cycle. When an experiment _does_ require changes in
        Firefox, other parameters can be changed, such as we did for topic preferences. The API
        schema does not list all New Tab experiments; only those which the backend uses to change
        its behavior. Any string or null is accepted.
    - `experimentBranch`: [Optional] The branch name of the Nimbus experiment that the user is in.
