# Configuring Merino (Operations)

## Settings

Merino's settings are managed via Dynaconf and can be specified in two ways: by a
TOML file in the `merino/configs/` directory, or via environment variables. Environment
variables take precedence over the values set in the TOML files. TOML files set with the
same environment name that is currently activated also automatically override defaults.
Any config file that is pointed to will override the `merino/configs/default.toml` file.
Read below for more specific details.

### [File organization](#file-organization)

These are the settings sources, with later sources overriding earlier ones.

- A `config.py` file establishes a Dynaconf instance and environment-specific values
are pulled in from the corresponding TOML files and environment variables. Other
configurations are established by files that are prefixed with `config_*.py`,
such as `config_sentry.py` or `config_logging.py`.

- Per-environment configuration files are in the `configs` directory. The environment
  is selected using the environment variable `MERINO_ENV`. The settings for
  that environment are then loaded from `configs/${env}.toml`, if the file/env exists. The
  default environment is "development". A "production" environment is also
  provided.

- Local configuration files are not checked into the repository, but if created should be named
  `configs/development.local.toml`, following the format of `<environment>.local.toml`.
  This file is listed in the `.gitignore` file and is safe to use for local configuration.
  One may secrets here if desired, though it is advised to exercise great caution.

### General

- All environments are prefixed with `MERINO_`. This is established in the
  `config.py` file by setting the `envvar_prefix="MERINO"` for the Dynaconf
  instance. The first level following `MERINO_` is accessed with a single underscore `_`
  and any subsequent levels require two underscores `__`. For example, `Settings::http::workers` can
  be controlled from the environment variable `MERINO_HTTP_WORKERS`.

- Production environment variables are set by SRE and stored in the
  cloudops project in the `configmap.yml` file. Contact SRE if you require
  information or access on this file, or request access to the cloudops infra
  repo.

- You can set these environment variables in your setup by modifying the `.toml` files.
  Conversely, when using `make`, you can prefix `make run` with overrides to the
  desired environment variables using CLI flags.

  Example:
  `MERINO_ENV=production MERINO_LOGGING__FORMAT=pretty make dev`

- `env` (`MERINO_ENV`) - Only settable from environment variables. Controls
  which environment configuration is loaded, as described above.

- `debug` (`MERINO_DEBUG`) - Boolean that enables additional features to debug
  the application. This should not be set to true in public environments, as it
  reveals all configuration, including any configured secrets.

- `format` (`MERINO_LOGGING__FORMAT`) - Controls the format of outputted logs in
  either `pretty` or `mozlog` format. See [../config_logging.py][log].


### Logging

Settings to control the format and amount of logs generated.

- `logging.format` - The format to emit logs in. One of

  - `pretty` (default in development) - Multiple lines per event, human-oriented
    formatting and color.
  - `mozlog` (default in production) - A single line per event, formatted as
    JSON in [MozLog](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Services/Logging) format.

- `logging.info` (`MERINO_LOGGING_LEVEL`) - Minimum level of logs that should
  be reported. This should be a number of _entries_ separated by commas (for
  environment variables) or specified as list (TOML).

  Each entry can be one of `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`,  or `DEBUG` (in
  increasing verbosity).

### Metrics

Settings for Statsd/Datadog style metrics reporting.

- `metrics.host` (`MERINO_METRICS__HOST`) - The IP or hostname to send metrics
  to over UDP. Defaults to localhost.

- `metrics.port` (`MERINO_METRICS__PORT`) - The port to send metrics to over
  UDP. Defaults to 8092.

- `metrics.dev_logger` (`MERINO_METRICS__DEV_LOGGER`) - Whether or not to send
  metrics over to the logger. Should only be used for non-production environments.

### Sentry

Error reporting via Sentry.

- `sentry.mode` (`MERINO_SENTRY__MODE`) - The type of Sentry integration to
  enable. One of `release`, `debug`, or `disabled`. The `debug` setting
  should only be used for local development.

If `sentry.mode` is set to `release`, then the following two settings are
required:

- `sentry.dsn` - Configuration to connect to the Sentry project.
- `sentry.env` - The environment to report to Sentry. Probably "prod",
  "stage", or "dev".

If `sentry.mode` is set to `disabled`, no Sentry integration will be activated.
If it is set to `debug`, the DSN will be set to a testing value
recommended by Sentry, and extra output will be included in the logs.

### Remote_settings

Connection to Remote Settings. This is used by the Remote Settings suggestion
provider below.

- `remote_settings.server` (`MERINO_REMOTE_SETTINGS__SERVER`) - The server to
  sync from. Example: `https://firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com`.

- `remote_settings.bucket` (`MERINO_REMOTE_SETTINGS__BUCKET`) -
  The bucket to use for Remote Settings providers if not specified in the
  provider config. Example: "main".

- `remote_settings.collection`
  (`MERINO_REMOTE_SETTINGS__COLLECTION`) - The collection to use for
  Remote Settings providers if not specified in the provider config. Example:
  "quicksuggest".

### Location

Configuration for determining the location of users.

- `location.maxmind_database` (`MERINO_LOCATION__MAXMIND_DATABASE`) - Path to a
  MaxMind GeoIP database file.

### Provider Configuration

The configuration for suggestion providers.

#### Adm Provider

These are production providers that generate suggestions.

- Remote Settings - Provides suggestions from a RS collection, such as the
  suggestions provided by adM. See also the top level configuration for Remote
  Settings above.
  - `resync_interval_sec` (`MERINO_PROVIDERS__ADM__RESYNC_INTERVAL_SEC`) - The time
    between re-syncs of Remote Settings data, in seconds. Defaults to 3 hours.
  - `cron_interval_sec`
    (`MERINO_PROVIDERS__ADM__CRON_INTERVAL_SEC`) - The interval of the Remote
    Settings cron job (in seconds). Following tasks are done in this cron job:
    - Resync with Remote Settings if needed. The resync interval is configured
      separately by the provider. Note that this interval should be set smaller
      than `resync_interval_sec` of the Remote Settings leaf provider.
    - Retry if the regular resync fails.
  - `score` (`MERINO_PROVIDERS__ADM__SCORE`) - The ranking score for this provider
    as a floating point number. Defaults to 0.3.

#### Adm Provider
- Wiki Fruit - Provides suggestions from a test provider. Should not be used
  in production.
  - `enabled` (`MERINO_PROVIDERS__WIKI_FRUIT__ENABLED`) - Whether or not to enable
    this provider.
