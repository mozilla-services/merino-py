# Merino

Merino is a service that provides address bar suggestions to Firefox. Some of this content
comes from third party providers. In this case, Merino serves as a privacy preserving
buffer. User input in the address bar is handled by Merino and any clicked impression
will be delegated to a Mozilla-controlled service which will then send an interaction 
ping if defined in the request and not to a provider directly. See API documentation
for more details.

## About the Name

This project drives an important part of Firefox's "felt experience". That is,
the feeling of using Firefox, hopefully in a delightful way. The word "felt" in
this phrase refers to feeling, but it can be punned to refer to the
[textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felt). Felt is often made of wool, and
Merino wool (from Merino sheep) produces exceptionally smooth felt.
