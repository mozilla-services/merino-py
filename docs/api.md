## Interaction Pings

When a Firefox user views or selects a suggestion from Merino, Firefox will send
an impression or a click ping to a Mozilla-controlled service indicating this
user interaction. Some suggestion providers may also need that interaction data
for reporting and relevancy optimization. Firefox will not send the pings to
those providers directly, rather, it will delegate those to a Mozilla-controlled
service, by which the interaction pings will be sent to the `impression_url` or
`click_url` specified by the providers.

If the URL for an interaction ping is not specified (for example, `click_url` is
`null`), then no ping should be sent to the provider for that action. However,
this interaction ping is always sent to the Mozilla-controlled service unless
the user opts out the telemetry collection of Firefox.

The required behavior for interaction pings is TBD.
