# The Release Process

This project currently follows a [Continuous Delivery][continuous_delivery] process, but it's gradually moving toward [Continuous Deployment][continuous_deployment].

[continuous_deployment]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment

Whenever a commit is pushed to this repository's `main` branch, the deployment pipeline kicks in, deploying the changeset to the [`stage` environment](../firefox.md#stage).
After the deployment is complete, accessing the [`__version__` endpoint][stage_version] will show the commit hash of the deployed version, which will eventually match to the one of the latest commit on the `main` branch (a node with an older version might still serve the request before it is shut down).

## Development Guidelines
Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md][contributing] docs on commit guidelines and pull request best practices.

## Versioning
The commit hash of the deployed code is considered its version identifier. The commit hash can be retrieved locally via `git rev-parse HEAD`.

## Preventing deployment via [do not deploy]
Occasionally developers might want to prevent a commit from triggering the deployment pipeline. While this should be discouraged, there are some legitimate cases for doing so (e.g. docs only changes).
In order to prevent the deployment of the code from a PR when merging to `main`, the **title of that PR** must contain the `[do not deploy]` text. When generating the merge commit for a branch within the GitHub UI, ensure that `[do not deploy]` is still present in the description, especially if you change or rename the PR later on.

For example:

```
# PR title (NOT the commit message)
doc: Add documentation for the release process [do not deploy]
```

While the `[do not deploy]` can be anywhere in the title, it is recommended to place it at its end in order to better integrate with the current PR title practices and improve readability.

The deployment pipeline will analyze the message of the merge commit (which will contain the PR title) and make a decision based on it.

## Load Testing
Load testing can be run locally or as a part of the deployment process. Local execution does not require any labeling in commit messages. For deployment, you have to add a label to the message of the commit that you wish to deploy in the form of: `[load test: (abort|warn)]`. In most cases this will be the merge commit created by merging a GitHub pull request.

Abort will prevent deployment should the load testing fail while warn will simply warn via Slack and continue deployment. For detailed specifics on load testing and this convention, please see the relevant documentation: [load-testing-docs]: /tests/load/README.md].

## Releasing to production
Developers with write access to the Merino repository can initiate a deployment to production after a Pull-Request on the Merino GitHub repository is merged to the `main` branch.
While any developer with write access can trigger the deployment to production, the _expectation_ is that individual(s) who authored and merged the Pull-Request should do so, as they are the ones most familiar with their changes and who can tell, by looking at the data, if anything looks anomalous.
In general authors should feel _responsible_ for the changes they make and shepherd these changes through to deployment.

Releasing to production can be done by:

1. opening the [CircleCI dashboard][circleci_dashboard];
2. looking up the pipeline named `merino <PR NUMBER>` running in the `main-workflow`; this pipeline should either be in a running status (if the required test jobs are still running) or in the "on hold" status, with the `unhold-to-deploy-to-prod` being held;
3. once in the "on hold" status, with all the other jobs successfully completed, clicking on the "thumbs up" action on the `unhold-to-deploy-to-prod` job row will approve it and trigger the deployment, unblocking the `deploy-to-prod` job;
4. developers **must** monitor the [Merino Application & Infrastructure][merino_app_info] dashboard for any anomaly, for example significant changes in HTTP response codes, increase in latency, cpu/memory usage (most things under the infrastructure heading).

## What to do if production breaks?
If your latest release causes problems and needs to be rolled back:
don't panic and follow the instructions below:

1. Depending on the severity of the problem, decide if this warrants [kicking off an incident][incident_docs];
2. Identify the problematic commit, as it may not necessarily be the latest one!
3. Revert the problematic commit, merge that into GitHub,
   then [deploy the revert commit to production](#releasing-to-production).
   - If a fix can be identified in a relatively short time,
     then you may submit a fix, rather than reverting the problematic commit.
