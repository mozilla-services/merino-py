g# Feature Flags

## Usage

Do you plan to release code behind a feature flag? Great! ðŸ˜ƒ

Your feature flag needs to be defined first. If it's already defined, go ahead.
Otherwise check the configuration section [below](#configuration) before you
continue.

Use the following line in API endpoint code to gain access to the feature flags
object:

```python
feature_flags: FeatureFlags = request.scope[ScopeKey.FEATURE_FLAGS]
```

Then check whether a certain feature flag, such as `example`, is enabled by calling:

```python
if feature_flags.is_enabled("example"):
    print("feature flag 'example' is enabled! ðŸš€")
```

When you do that, the decision (whether the feature flag is enabled or not) is
recorded and stored in a `dict` on the `decisions` attribute of the feature
flags object.

## Implementation

The feature flags system in Merino consists of three components:

| Description | Location |
| ----------- | -------- |
| A FastAPI middleware that reads the query parameter `sid` sent by the client application and sets a session ID for the current request based on that. | `merino/middleware/featureflags.py`|
| A `FeatureFlags` class which you can use to check if a certain feature flag is enabled. | `merino/featureflags.py` |
| A local directory containing static files that define and configure feature flags for Merino. | `merino/configs/flags/` |

## Configuration

Currently two bucketing schemes are supported: `random` and `session`.

### Random

Random does what it says on the tin. It generates a random bucketing ID for
every flag check.

### Session

Session bucketing uses the session ID of the request as the bucketing key so
that feature checks within a given search session would be consistent.

### Fields

Each flag defines the following fields:

```toml
[default.flags.<flag_name>]
scheme = 'session'
enabled = 0.5
```

| Field | Description |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `scheme` | This is the bucketing scheme for the flag. Allowed values are `'random'` and `'session'` |
| `enabled` | This represents the % enabled for the flag and must be a float between `0` and `1` |


## Metrics

When submitting application metrics, feature flag decisions that were made while
processing the current request up to this point are **automatically** added as
tags to the emitted metrics.

The format of these tags is:

```
feature_flag.<feature_flag_name>
```

For more information about this see the `ClientMeta` meta class and the
`add_feature_flags` decorator in `merino/metrics.py`.

## Monitoring in Grafana

Because feature flag decisions are automatically added as tags to emitted
metrics, you can use them in your queries in Grafana. ðŸ“ˆ

For example, if you want to group by decisions for a feature flag with name
`hello_world`, you can use `tag(feature_flag.hello_world)` in `GROUP BY` in
Grafana. You can also use `[[tag_feature_flag.hello_world]]` in the `ALIAS` for
panel legends.
