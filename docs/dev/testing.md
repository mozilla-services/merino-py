# Testing strategies

Merino is tested using a combination of functional and performance tests.

Test code resides in the `tests` directory.

## Functional

The functional test strategy is four-tiered, composed of: unit, integration, contract
and end-to-end testing.

### Unit Tests

The unit layer is suitable for testing complex behavior at a small scale, with
fine-grained control over the inputs. Due to their narrow scope, unit tests are
fundamental to thorough test coverage.

To execute unit tests, use: `make unit-tests`

Unit tests are written and executed with pytest and are located in the `tests/unit`
directory, using the same organizational structure as the source code of the merino
service. Type aliases dedicated for test should be stored in the `types.py` module.
The `conftest.py` modules contain common utilities in fixtures.

For a breakdown of fixtures in use per test, use: `make unit-test-fixtures`

Available fixtures include:

#### FilterCaplogFixture
Useful when verifying log messages, this fixture filters log records captured with
pytest's caplog by a given `logger_name`.

_**Usage:**_
```python
def test_with_filter_caplog(
    caplog: LogCaptureFixture, filter_caplog: FilterCaplogFixture
) -> None:
    records: list[LogRecord] = filter_caplog(caplog.records, "merino.providers.adm")
```
Note: This fixture is shared with integration tests.

#### SuggestionRequestFixture
For use when querying providers, this fixture creates a SuggestionRequest object with
a given `query`

_**Usage:**_
```python
def test_with_suggestion_request(srequest: SuggestionRequestFixture) -> None:
    request: SuggestionRequest = srequest("example")
    result: list[BaseSuggestion] = await provider.query(request)
```

#### ScopeFixture, ReceiveMockFixture & SendMockFixture
For use when testing middleware, these fixtures initialize or mock the common Scope,
Receive and Send object dependencies.

_**Usage:**_
```python
def test_middleware(scope: Scope, receive_mock: Receive, send_mock: Send) -> None:
    pass
````

### Integration Tests

The integration layer of testing allows for verification of interactions between
service components, with lower development, maintenance and execution costs compared
with higher level tests, such as contract tests.

To execute integration tests, use: `make integration-tests`

Integration tests are located in the `tests/integration` directory. They use pytest and
the FastAPI `TestClient` to send requests to specific merino endpoints and verify
responses as well as other outputs, such as logs. Tests are organized according to the
API path under test. Type aliases dedicated for test should be stored in the `types.py`
module. Fake providers created for test should be stored in the `fake_providers.py`
module. The `conftest.py` modules contain common utilities in fixtures.

For a breakdown of fixtures in use per test, use: `make integration-test-fixtures`

Available fixtures include:

#### FilterCaplogFixture

[Details](#FilterCaplogFixture) available in Unit Tests section

#### TestClientFixture
This fixture creates an instance of the TestClient to be used in testing API calls.

_**Usage:**_
```python
def test_with_test_client(client: TestClient):
    response: Response = client.get("/api/v1/endpoint")
```

#### TestClientWithEventsFixture
This fixture creates an instance of the TestClient, that will trigger event handlers
(i.e. `startup` and `shutdown`) to be used in testing API calls.

_**Usage:**_
```python
def test_with_test_client_with_event(client_with_events: TestClient):
    response: Response = client_with_events.get("/api/v1/endpoint")
```

#### RequestSummaryLogDataFixture
This fixture will extract the extra log data from a captured 'request.summary'
LogRecord for verification

_**Usage:**_
```python
def test_with_log_data(
    caplog: LogCaptureFixture,
    filter_caplog: FilterCaplogFixture,
    extract_request_summary_log_data: LogDataFixture
):
    records: list[LogRecord] = filter_caplog(caplog.records, "request.summary")
    assert len(records) == 1

    record: LogRecord = records[0]
    log_data: dict[str, Any] = extract_request_summary_log_data(record)
    assert log_data == expected_log_data
```

#### InjectProvidersFixture & ProvidersFixture
These fixture will setup and teardown given providers.

_**Usage:**_

If specifying providers for a module:
```python
@pytest.fixture(name="providers")
def fixture_providers() -> Providers:
    return {"test-provider": TestProvider()}
```

If specifying providers for a test:
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("providers", [{"test-provider": TestProvider()}])
def test_with_provider() -> None:
    pass
```

#### SetupProvidersFixture
This fixture sets application provider dependency overrides.

_**Usage:**_
```python
def test_with_setup_providers(setup_providers: SetupProvidersFixture):
    providers: dict[str, BaseProvider] = {"test-provider": TestProvider()}
    setup_providers(providers)
```

#### TeardownProvidersFixture
This fixture resets application provider dependency overrides and is often used in
teardown fixtures.

_**Usage:**_
```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def teardown(teardown_providers: TeardownProvidersFixture):
    yield
    teardown_providers()
```

### Contract Tests

The tests in the `tests/contract` directory are contract tests
that consume Merino's APIs using more opaque techniques. These tests run against
a Docker container of the service, specify settings via environment variables,
and operate on the HTTP API layer only and as such are more concerned with
external contracts and behavior. The contract tests cannot configure the server
per test.

For more details see the README.md file in the `test/contract` directory.

### End-to-End Tests

The end-to-end tests are executed manually by Softvision.

## Performance

### Load Tests

The tests in the `tests/load` directory are load tests that spawn multiple HTTP
clients that consume Merino's API in order to simulate real-world load on the Merino
infrastructure. These tests use the Locust framework and are triggered manually at the
discretion of the Merino Engineering Team.


For more details see the README.md file in the `test/load` directory.
